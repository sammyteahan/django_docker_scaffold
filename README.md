## Django Scaffold

Django 1.11 was just announced as an LTS release so this project structure should be valid until 2.x comes out. It's a good start for any Django project and aims to provide a central place to put all apps, and make configuration between different environments trivial.

###### Getting started

Assuming docker for mac is already installed, the setup should be a breeze:

```
$> git clone https://github.com/sammyteahan/django_docker_scaffold.git
$> cd django_docker_scaffold
$> docker-compose up
```
